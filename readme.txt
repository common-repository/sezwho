SezWho is a distributed ratings and reputation system for blogs.

== Description ==

<p><strong>What is SezWho</strong></p>
<p>SezWho is a distributed context, rating and reputation system for social media sites like blogs, forums, wikis, video/picture sharing sites, discussion boards and anywhere else where people collaborate on the web. SezWho is focused on delivering benefits to all stakeholders in social media interactions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Readers</strong> can easily separate quality content from uninteresting content. </li>
<li><strong>Contributors</strong> get recognized and rewarded for their efforts by building portable credibility.</li>

<li><strong>Site-Owners</strong> benefit by having a more engaged community and get additional traffic based on SezWho's unique contributor-oriented content discovery system. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some of the key attributes of the SezWho solution are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Site-owners retain all their content</strong>. SezWho does not take over commenting or discussion systems, it just makes them more useful by incentivizing participation and making it easy to find quality content. </li>
<li>Unlike other reputation systems, SezWho is <strong>fully integrated</strong> into the host site. As such, users of a site stay on the site for all operations like rating, viewing profiles and filtering content.</li>
<li>In order to make online community interactions more like real-life, the SezWho rating system mimics the reputation mechanisms of the real world. SezWho takes into account the reputation of the rater, the context of the rating and the timing of the interaction to assign a more <strong>accurate and tamper-proof rating</strong>. </li>

<li>SezWho enables contributors to build <strong>portable reputation</strong>. Without SezWho user reputations are confined to a single site. With SezWho users carry their reputation across all sites.</li>
<li>SezWho provides <strong>insightful stats</strong> for contributors and site-owners. Contributor Stats show how many people are rating and viewing a contributor's profile. Site Stats show how much traffic SezWho is driving and where the traffic coming from. </li>
<li><strong>Identity authentication</strong> is the cornerstone of any good reputation system. SezWho supports <strong>Reputation Protection</strong> which enables users to lock down their profiles. When a profile is Reputation Protected, any new interaction will require explicit user authorization. This allows users to fully control their participation profiles. </li>

<li>SezWho engages your online community by increasing the quality and  frequency of  interactions. With portable credibility, more readers are motivated to contribute. SezWho lowers the threshold for participation so that even readers, who don't post, can participate by voting. Typically, SezWho at least <strong>doubles the number of user interactions</strong> in an online community.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>  How does SezWho drive additional traffic to my site? </strong></p>
<p>
  SezWho drives additional traffic by developing user-centric profiles. These profiles are displayed in the context of new user contributions. See screenshots for an example of a user profile: </p>
<p> These profiles typically expose links to older content on the same site. Readers, who find a contribution interesting, can click on these links to see what else the contributor posted. These clicks drive additional page views to the site. Typically this unique user based content discovery mechanism drives 10-15% additional page views (percentage of profile views) to the site. <br />

== Installation ==
<p>The latest version of the SezWho plugin can be <a href="http://sezwho.com/releases/wp/2.2/sezwho22.zip">downloaded here</a>. You need at least WordPress version 1.5 or above for everything to work.</p>

<h4>Steps to Install</h4>

<ul> 
<li>
Download the plugin
</li>
<li>
Unzip or copy the files into WordPress plug-in directory (wp-content/plugins). This should create a folder in wp-content/plugins/sezwho. 
</li>
<li>
Go to WordPress plug-ins page and activate the plugin. 
</li>
<li>
Enter your blog key (<a href="htt://www.sezwho.com/register.php">Get your blog key here</a>) in the SezWho plug-in configuration (under the plug-ins tab) page. 
</li>
<li>
You are almost there...The plugin should be functional now. The only thing remaining to do is to add the new sidebar widgets. To do that go to Presentation->Widgets page in your Wordpress admin screens to place and configure the Red Carpet and Badge Widgets (these widgets should show up in the "Available Widgets" section to be dragged and dropped in the sidebar) on the sidebar. If you need more than one Badge widget, you can add them at the bottom of the screen. (<a href="http://sezwho.com/install_wp_d.php#redcarpet">you can also manually modify your siderbar to show these widgets</a>)
</li>
</ul>

<p>After the installation is complete, access a post that has comments and make sure that the filter bar, comment score and comment ratings bar is showing as <a href="javascript:void window.open('http://www.sezwho.com/popup_help.php', 'name','height=600,width=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,toolbar=no')">in this screenshot</a>. </p>
